# SnackOverflow

SnackOverflow is the premier knowledge base for those involved or interested in the world of snacks.

You can run the app using:

```
rails server
```

The app is built using standard Rails practices: a few resourceful routes backed by some ActiveRecord models. The commit messages contain information on the design choices at various points in development.

## Future development

If I had more time, I would focus on the following:

* List of questions
* Consistent page layout and navigation
* Voting
* Ordering questions based on votes, with a time-based decay for relevancy
* Search questions/answers
* Editing questions (storing history of changes)
